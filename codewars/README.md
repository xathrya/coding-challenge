My solution to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) Katas

This repo is used as my note for solving some coding challenge. The solution should be as simple as possible. Most of the solution will use Python and Rust and written in a file according to the language. The solutions will be divided into levels (kyus and dans) for better organization.

The solution should be safe, i.e. not producing undefined behavior.
